# CI/CD

### What is it?

It is a method in which some of the processes are automated to deliver a product more efficiently and more frequently.  `Continous Integration` is when all members of the team continously integrate their work into a single repository.  `Continuous Delivery` is when enough automation from the integration part of the system has been successfully tested to the point where the product can be continuously delivered. `Continuous Deployment` is when the process of continous delivery can be automated.  This makes things more efficient, but sometimes it is preferable to use continuous delivery.  For example, if there is more time, you may want to deliver after checking first, in which case delivery would be preferable.

### Why is it so useful?

It is popular in DevOps because it makes things more efficient with less human errors and ultimately speeds everything up.  It makes it easier to spot and fix bugs.
